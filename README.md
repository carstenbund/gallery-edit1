# gallery-edit1
Html editor for json based gallery

This editor works with a single page display sustem that reads a json file to describe the content of the gallery.

The editor allows modificaltion of said json file. 

The main motivation for this is the resulting simplicity and speed of display. 
All rendering happens on client side, while all files are served as static files.
